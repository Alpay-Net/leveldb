LevelDB B14 branch
==================

Current version: 1.13

Bureau 14 [LevelDB](http://code.google.com/p/leveldb/) branch with full Windows support. This is not an official LevelDB branch, but the branch we use in our [quasardb](https://www.quasardb.net/) product.

* Requires [Boost](http://www.boost.org/);
* Is C++11ized;
* Is not 100% compliant with ugly Google coding style;
* Will probably need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) to be built.

Tested on [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org/), Linux and Windows (32-bit & 64-bit).

Might contains trace of nuts.
